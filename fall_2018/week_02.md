## Last Week's Accomplishments

Prototype the backend database structure, and learn more about the types of data structure that Redis server support.

## This Week's Plan

In the next week, I plan to learn more about the Redis server, and connect the redis to our Appache server, and create a database migration file for testing.

Also, should finish the user login and register function.


## Anything Blocking?

My had some experience with MySQL server, but less experience with the redis server, so It is kind of blocking, we shoul practice more.
