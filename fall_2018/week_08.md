## Last Week's Accomplishments

I was learning some thing about Angular.js
I was trying to make a simple front end structure of our game.

## This Week's Plan

Integrate the database with front end framework, so that we could do some interaction.

## Anything Blocking?

The redis server is different from the SQL i have experienced with, so it is kind of blocking.
