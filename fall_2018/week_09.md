## Last Week's Accomplishments

We decide to make a client game rather than a web game becasue we found that there are too much thigns blocking us from make a web game.

## This Week's Plan

Learn more about pygame and try to understand what is currently going on.
Review the materials of language python, becasue they are pretty related.

## Anything Blocking?

NO experience on client game either...
