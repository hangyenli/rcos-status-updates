## Last Week's Accomplishments

editing the game.py and player.py
Adding more character moving instrustions around the edge of the map.
fixed a minor bug when character moves to the right bottom of the map and the game sence would crash.


## This Week's Plan

keep working on character's moving functionality and debugging.
Moving forward to the implement the actual map

## Anything Blocking?

because we have not yet finish the actual map, so the code writing is kind of conceptual and hard to undersatnd and debug
